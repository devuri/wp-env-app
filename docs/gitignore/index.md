# Git Ignore for the Project Framework

This is a comprehensive `.gitignore` file for your project, designed to exclude various files and directories from version control when using Git. 

By using this `.gitignore` file, you can prevent unnecessary files or directories from being accidentally committed to your repository.

## Files and Directories Ignored

Here is a list of files and directories that are ignored by this `.gitignore` file:

### General Files and Directories

- `node_modules/`: This directory is ignored. It is typically used to store project dependencies installed by Node.js and should not be committed to version control.

- `tmp/`: This directory is ignored. It is a common location for temporary or cache files.

- `public/assets/dist/`: This directory is ignored. It may contain compiled or built assets.

- `public/assets/mix.js.map`: This specific file is ignored. It is typically generated by the Laravel Mix build process.

- `build/deploy/`: This directory is ignored. It may contain files related to deployment, which should not be committed.

- `vendor/`: This directory is ignored. It contains the dependencies installed by Composer.

### WordPress Files and Directories

- `public/app/templates/`: This subdirectory is not ignored. It contains templates and is intended for version control.

- `public/mu-plugins/.gitkeep`: This file is not ignored. It ensures that the `mu-plugins/` directory remains in version control and is kept empty.

- `public/mu-plugins/compose.php`: This specific file is not ignored. It may be a core mu-plugin a critical component for the framework.
