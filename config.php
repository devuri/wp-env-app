/*
 * This file contains configuration settings for the web application.
 *
 * It can be used to define constants, variables, and other settings that are used throughout the application.
 * By modifying the values in this file, you can change how the application behaves in different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
 *
 * It's strongly recommended that you use use the .env file to store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials).
 * This allows you to keep your sensitive information separate from your codebase and prevent accidental exposure.
 *
 * You use this file to override default WordPress constants set by the framework.
 * For example, you can define a new value for the `WP_DEBUG` constant to enable or disable debugging mode.
 *
 * If you need to modify the behavior of the application, you should do so by changing the values in this file, rather than modifying the core code.
 * This makes it easier to maintain the application and deploy updates without introducing new bugs or breaking changes.
 *
